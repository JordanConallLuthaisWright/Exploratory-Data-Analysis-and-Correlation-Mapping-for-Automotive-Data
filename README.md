# Automotive Data Analysis: Correlation Mapping and Feature Engineering for Pattern Recognition

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **correlation mapping** on an automotive dataset to uncover relationships between different vehicle attributes. The analysis leverages **feature engineering, data preprocessing, and advanced visualization techniques** to extract meaningful insights.

---

## Project Aim  
The goal of this project is to analyze automotive data and identify key **correlations between numerical features**. The study provides insights into **vehicle performance, pricing factors, and attribute dependencies**, which can be useful for **predictive modeling, pricing strategies, and feature selection** in machine learning applications.
